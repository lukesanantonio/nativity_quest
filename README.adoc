== What the game looks like

Spawning in:

image::newturn.png[Wow, these graphics are bad!]

Uh oh!

image::uhoh.png[Something just spawned, a giant I think.]

That's not a giant!

image::knight.png[A picture of a knight is supposed to be here; hence the joke.]

It's animated, and I drew it too!

image::uncrating.png[Imagine an 8-bit chest opening. Then imagine a 3-year old using paint and you've got it.]

Wow I wonder what it does!

image::finding.png[So do I]
